I am AI researcher at [NAVER WEBTOON](https://webtoonscorp.com/en/), where my expertise lies in computer vision. Specifically, my interests span in the design and implementation of generative AI models that are user-centric, and devising strategic approaches to making these models accessible to the users.

Before joining Webtoon AI, I recieved my Ph.D. from Ajou University in 2021 under the guidance of [Prof. Kyung-Ah Sohn](https://sites.google.com/site/kasohn/home). During that time, my works primarily revolved around image enhancement and restoration projects, including image super-resolution. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Media from Ajou University in 2016.

At present, I am particularly interested in the creation of user-friendly tools for content generation. My ultimate goal is to establish a user-informed framework for media generation, translation, or manipulation, utilizing the power of contemporary generative AI models.
