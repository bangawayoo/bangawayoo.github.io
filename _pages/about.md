I am currently an AI researcher at [NAVER WEBTOON](https://webtoonscorp.com/en/), specializing in computer vision. My focus is on the development of user-centric generative AI models and finding effective ways to deliver these to users.

I earned my Ph.D. from Ajou University in 2021 under the guidance of [Prof. Kyung-Ah Sohn](https://sites.google.com/site/kasohn/home). My work primarily revolved around image enhancement and restoration projects, including image super-resolution. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Media from Ajou University in 2016.

At present, my research interests lie in the development of user-friendly content creation tools. My primary goal is to establish a framework for media generation, translation, or manipulation that is based on user-guided information, capitalizing on the capabilities of recent generative AI models.
