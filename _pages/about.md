I am a Ph.D. candidate at Seoul National University under Nojun Kwakâ€™s guidance. My research interest lies in building safer language models through mitigating hallucinations, watermarking, and enhancing adversarial robustness. 

Currently, I am also interested in building language models for domain-specific applications.
